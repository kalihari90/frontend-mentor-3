## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

There was nothing new on this project. I practiced reading values from figma file to make my project as perfect as possible. I think I'm very close to be pixel perfect. I'm proud of myself, because this project didn't take much time. I'm coding faster but unfortunatetly I don't practics regularly yet.

### Continued development

I'm going to do all newbie challenges. One by week so I will finish all of them in few months.

### Useful resources

- [Figma developers guide](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/09/figma-developers-guide/) - This guide helped me to better undersatnd how to use Figma file.
